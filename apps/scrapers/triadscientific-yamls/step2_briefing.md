# Briefing for Step 2 - URL Discovery Mechanism

## Overview of Step 1 Completion

Step 1 of the Triad Scientific scraper implementation has been completed. We've analyzed the website structure at http://www.triadscientific.com and documented the navigation hierarchy, URL patterns, and content structures. The comprehensive analysis is available in the updated `CurrentPlan.md` file.

## Key Findings from Step 1

1. **Main Category Structure**:
   - The website has 5 main category sections:
     - Lab Instrument
     - Lab casework, Furniture, Hoods, Blowers
     - Instrument Parts and accessories
     - Lab Instrumentation and Equipment
     - New Lab Equipment

2. **Hierarchical Navigation**:
   - Each main category contains multiple subcategories (e.g., FTIR Systems, Analytical Balances)
   - Products are listed within these subcategories

3. **URL Patterns**:
   - Main site: `http://www.triadscientific.com/`
   - Category pages: `http://www.triadscientific.com/en/products/[category]/[id]`
   - Product pages: `http://www.triadscientific.com/en/products/[category]/[id]/[product-name]/[product-id]`

4. **Product Listings Format**:
   - Products are listed with titles and "+ details" links
   - There may be pagination on category pages (to be confirmed)

## Your Task: Create URL Discovery Mechanism

Your task is to implement YAML selectors and a discovery strategy to extract all product URLs from the website. You should:

1. **Create YAML selectors** for:
   - `categories.yaml`: Extract main category URLs
   - `subcategories.yaml`: Extract subcategory URLs from main categories
   - `product_urls.yaml`: Extract product URLs from subcategory pages
   - `pagination.yaml`: Handle any pagination (if present)

2. **Develop a URL discovery strategy** that:
   - Starts with the main categories
   - Navigates through subcategories
   - Collects all product page URLs
   - Handles pagination if present

3. **Implement error handling** for failed URL extractions

## Suggested CSS Selectors (Preliminary)

These are preliminary suggestions based on Step 1 analysis:

- Main categories:
  ```
  div.category-column a
  ```

- Subcategories:
  ```
  ul.subcategories li a
  ```

- Product links:
  ```
  div.product-item a
  ```
  or
  ```
  a:contains("+ details")
  ```

- Pagination:
  ```
  div.pagination a
  ```

## Development Approach

1. **Start with testing selectors** on the live website
2. **Create individual YAML files** for each type of selector
3. **Test each selector** on various sections of the site
4. **Combine into a discovery approach** that can navigate from main categories to product pages
5. **Document any edge cases** or variations you discover

## Tips and Considerations

- Use the existing selector system in `apps/scrapers/selectors/` directory
- Reference the AirScience selectors in `apps/scrapers/airscience-yamls/` for examples
- Test selectors on different categories to ensure they work across the site
- Consider rate limiting to avoid overloading the website
- Handle relative URLs that might need to be converted to absolute URLs
- Don't forget to check for pagination on category pages

## Expected Output

By the end of Step 2, you should deliver:
1. YAML selector files in the `apps/scrapers/triadscientific-yamls/` directory
2. Documentation on how the URL discovery process works
3. Notes on any challenges encountered and how they were addressed
4. A clear handoff for Step 3, which will focus on product information extraction

If you have any questions or need clarification about the website structure, refer to the detailed analysis in `CurrentPlan.md` or ask the project coordinator.

Good luck with your implementation!
