# Briefing for Step 3b - Testing and Refining Product Information Extractors

## Overview of Step 3 Implementation

In Step 3, we developed a set of YAML selectors for extracting product information from Triad Scientific product pages. The implementation includes:

1. **`name.yaml`**: For extracting product names from `<h1>` tags
2. **`imgs.yaml`**: For extracting product images from the carousel
3. **`short_description.yaml`**: For extracting brief product summaries
4. **`full_description.yaml`**: For extracting complete product descriptions
5. **`specs_groups.yaml`**: For extracting technical specifications from description text
6. **`models.yaml`**: For creating a simplified model structure
7. **`mapping.yaml`**: For combining all component extractors

However, we encountered integration issues during testing due to Django's app registry requirements, and we were unable to validate the effectiveness of these selectors across different product pages.

## Your Task: Testing and Refining Selectors

Your task for Step 3b is to thoroughly test and refine the YAML selectors to ensure they work correctly across various product types and handle edge cases gracefully. This involves:

### 1. Testing Environment Setup

- Set up a proper testing environment within the Django framework
- Use the Django management command to test the selectors:
  ```
  python manage.py scrape_page --config apps/scrapers/triadscientific-yamls/mapping.yaml [URL]
  ```
- Test on multiple product URLs from different categories

### 2. Selector Refinement

Based on testing results, refine the selectors to:

- Handle variations in product page structures
- Fix any extraction issues identified during testing
- Improve specification extraction patterns to capture more data

### 3. Edge Case Handling

Ensure the selectors gracefully handle:

- Products with missing images
- Products with minimal or no specifications
- Unusual formatting in descriptions or specifications
- Products with extra information not covered by current selectors

### 4. Documentation Updates

Document any changes made to the selectors and provide a comprehensive report on:
- Testing methodology and results
- Issues discovered and how they were resolved
- Recommendations for implementing Step 4

## Sample Product URLs for Testing

To help you get started, here are some product URLs from different categories that should be tested:

1. FTIR/Spectroscopy: 
   ```

   ```

2. HPLC Component:

   ```

3. Atomic Absorption: 
   ```

   ```

4. Microscopes:

   ```

## Expected Output

By the end of Step 3b, you should deliver:

1. Refined and working YAML selector files
2. A summary document explaining your testing process and results
3. Documentation of any changes made to the selectors
4. Guidance for Step 4 implementation based on your findings

Good luck with refining and testing the selectors!
