# Step 6 Requirements Update

## New Python Package Dependencies

The enhanced Triad Scientific scraper implementation adds the following new dependencies:

| Package | Version | Purpose |
|---------|---------|---------|
| tqdm | >=4.62.0 | Progress bar visualization for improved monitoring |

## Installation

To install the new dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or install the specific package:

```bash
pip install tqdm>=4.62.0
```

## Docker Environment Update

If you're using Docker, you'll need to update your Dockerfile or docker-compose.yml to include the new dependency.

### Dockerfile Example

```dockerfile
# Add this to your existing Dockerfile
RUN pip install tqdm>=4.62.0
```

### requirements.txt Update

Add the following line to your requirements.txt file:

```
tqdm>=4.62.0
```

## System Requirements

The parallel processing feature may increase resource requirements:

- **CPU**: Additional cores will improve parallel processing performance
- **Memory**: Increased memory usage proportional to the number of worker threads
- **Disk**: Additional space for checkpoint files and more detailed logging

## Compatibility Notes

- The enhanced scraper is compatible with Python 3.6+ and Django 3.0+
- The tqdm package is cross-platform and works on all major operating systems
- Signal handling for graceful shutdown works best on Unix-based systems (Linux, macOS)

## Verification

To verify that the new dependencies are properly installed, run:

```bash
python -c "import tqdm; print(f'tqdm version: {tqdm.__version__}')"
```

This should print the installed version of tqdm without errors.
