# Step 2 Summary: URL Discovery Mechanism

This document summarizes the implementation of Step 2 for the Triad Scientific scraper: creating the URL discovery mechanism.

## Website Structure Insights

After thorough analysis, we discovered that triadscientific.com has a simpler structure than initially anticipated:

1. **Main Categories**: The website has approximately 246 direct category pages accessible from the homepage
2. **Product Pages**: Each category page lists products with "+ details" links
3. **No true subcategory hierarchy**: While visually grouped into sections like "Lab Instrumentation", "Lab Equipment", etc., the actual URL structure uses a flat category approach

## YAML Selectors Implemented

We created three YAML selector files to extract different types of URLs from the Triad Scientific website:

1. **`categories.yaml`**: Extracts all category URLs (246 total) from the homepage
   - Uses CSS selector to find links containing "/products/" in the href
   - Filters using regex to match the pattern: `/en/products/[category]/[id]`
   - Extracts both the URL and category name

2. **`product_urls.yaml`**: Extracts product URLs from category pages
   - Targets links with the text "+ details"
   - Extracts product names from text preceding the links
   - Ensures all URLs are converted to absolute URLs

3. **`pagination.yaml`**: Handles pagination on category pages
   - Targets links within pagination divs or lists
   - Follows pagination links to discover all products

## URL Discovery Implementation

We implemented a Python module (`url_discovery.py`) that:

1. **Loads YAML Selectors**: Reads and parses the YAML selector files
2. **Implements a Two-Level Discovery Process**:
   - First level: Extract all 246 category URLs from the homepage
   - Second level: For each category, extract all product URLs
3. **Includes Error Handling and Rate Limiting**:
   - Implements rate limiting (1 second delay between requests) to avoid overwhelming the website
   - Handles network errors gracefully
   - Tracks visited URLs to avoid duplicates
4. **Saves Results**: Stores discovered product URLs and names to a text file

Our approach is optimized for the website's actual structure, focusing on direct category-to-product navigation rather than the three-tier approach initially considered.

## Testing and Validation

We developed comprehensive testing capabilities:

1. **Test Modes**:
   - `main`: Tests main category extraction
   - `products`: Tests product URL extraction for one category
   - `single`: Tests full workflow for a single category
   - `all`: Runs complete URL discovery process

2. **Sample Testing**:
   - Tested on 5 categories, successfully extracting 141 products
   - Verified product names and URLs are correctly captured

## Output Format

The discovery process saves product URLs and their names to a text file, with each line containing:
```
[product_url] | [product_name]
```

For example:
```
http://www.triadscientific.com/en/products/atomic-absorption/942/agilent-240fs-aa-spectrometer-no-ultraa-used-mint/260487 | Agilent 240FS AA Spectrometer, no UltrAA used MINT like new AGILENT G8432-64000
```

This format provides a solid foundation for Step 3, where product information extraction will be implemented.

## Next Steps for Step 3

For the next step (developing product information extractors), we recommend:

1. Examine the product detail pages using the discovered URLs
2. Create YAML selectors for key product information (name, descriptions, specifications, images)
3. Handle variations in product page layouts
4. Implement error handling for missing elements
