# Briefing for Step 3 - Product Information Extractors

## Overview of Step 2 Completion

Step 2 of the Triad Scientific scraper implementation has been completed successfully. We have created YAML selectors and a Python module that discovers product URLs from the triadscientific.com website. Our key findings include:

1. The website has a simpler structure than initially anticipated, with only two main levels:
   - **Level 1**: 246 direct category pages (e.g., "Atomic Absorption", "Calorimeters", etc.)
   - **Level 2**: Product pages within each category
   
2. While the site visually groups categories under main sections like "Lab Instrumentation", "Lab Equipment", etc., these are not separate navigation levels in the URL structure.

3. We've successfully implemented a complete URL discovery mechanism that:
   - Starts from the homepage
   - Extracts all 246 category URLs
   - Navigates to each category and extracts all product URLs with their names
   - Handles any pagination that might be present
   - Saves the results in a format that includes both URLs and product names

4. Sample testing shows the process works correctly, with all product URLs successfully extracted.

## Your Task: Develop Product Information Extractors

Your task for Step 3 is to implement YAML selectors that extract detailed product information from the product pages. You need to create the following YAML files:

1. **`name.yaml`**: Extract product names/titles
2. **`short_description.yaml`**: Extract product summaries/brief descriptions
3. **`full_description.yaml`**: Extract detailed product descriptions
4. **`imgs.yaml`**: Extract product images
5. **`specs_groups.yaml`**: Extract technical specifications (if available)
6. **`models.yaml`**: Extract product model information (if available)

## Product Page Structure Analysis

To help you get started, here's an example product page URL that you can examine:
```
http://www.triadscientific.com/en/products/atomic-absorption/942/universal-xyz-autosampler-auroraa-s-revolutionary/250558
```

Based on our preliminary analysis, Triad Scientific product pages typically have:

- Product name/title in heading elements
- Product descriptions in paragraph elements
- Technical specifications (when available) in tables or structured div elements
- Product images
- "Other items in same category" section at the bottom

## Development Strategy

1. **Examine Sample Product Pages**: Use a few of the discovered product URLs to analyze the HTML structure
2. **Start Simple**: Implement the name.yaml first as it's usually the most straightforward
3. **Incremental Testing**: Test each selector individually on multiple product pages
4. **Handle Variations**: Some products may have different information patterns
5. **Error Handling**: Implement fallback selectors where possible for missing elements

## Suggested CSS Selectors (Starting Points)

Here are some preliminary suggestions based on our analysis:

- Product name: `h1`, `h2`, or possibly `div.product-title`
- Product description: Look for `div.product-description p`, `div#description`, or similar content blocks
- Product images: `div.product-images img`, `div.gallery img` or similar image containers
- Technical specifications: Tables `table.specs` or structured div elements

## Output Format Considerations

For each selector, consider the output format:
- Names and short descriptions should be plain text
- Full descriptions might need HTML content preservation
- Images need complete URLs (use the url_join transformation)
- Specifications should be structured in groups if possible

## Tips and Considerations

- Reference the AirScience selectors in `apps/scrapers/airscience-yamls/` for implementation patterns
- The website seems to use relatively consistent HTML patterns across products, but be prepared for variations
- Some products may have minimal information while others are more comprehensive
- Look for patterns in how specifications are structured (tables, lists, etc.)
- Products in different categories might have slightly different page structures

## Expected Output

By the end of Step 3, you should deliver:
1. Complete set of YAML selector files for product information extraction
2. A summary document explaining your implementation and any patterns discovered
3. Notes on challenges encountered and how they were addressed
4. Guidance for Step 4 (creating the mapping file)

Good luck with your implementation!
