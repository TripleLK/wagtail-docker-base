# Step 1 Summary: Website Structure Analysis

This document summarizes the findings from Step 1 of the Triad Scientific scraper implementation plan: analyzing the triadscientific.com website structure.

## Key Findings

### Navigation Structure

The website has a three-tier hierarchical navigation:

1. **Main Categories**:
   - Lab Instrumentation
   - Lab Equipment
   - Lab Furniture

2. **Subcategories**:
   - Under Lab Instrumentation: FTIR Systems, GC, HPLC, etc.
   - Under Lab Equipment: Balances, Centrifuges, etc.
   - Under Lab Furniture: Fume Hoods, Casework, etc.

3. **Product Listings**:
   - Individual products listed within each subcategory

### URL Patterns

Clear and consistent URL patterns have been identified:
- Main site: `http://www.triadscientific.com/`
- Category pages: `http://www.triadscientific.com/en/products/[category]/[id]`
- Product pages: `http://www.triadscientific.com/en/products/[category]/[id]/[product-name]/[product-id]`

### Product Page Structure

Product pages follow a consistent structure with:
- Product title/name in a heading
- Descriptive text for the product
- Technical specifications (when available)
- Images of the product
- Related products or recommendations
- Standard company information in the footer

### Data Elements to Extract

We've identified these key elements for extraction:
- Product name
- Short and full descriptions
- Technical specifications
- Product images
- Product categories
- Model variants (when applicable)

### HTML Structure

The HTML structure is relatively straightforward with:
- Standard heading elements for titles
- Paragraph tags for descriptions
- Image tags for product images
- Structured elements (tables/lists) for specifications
- Navigation elements for categories

## Challenges Identified

1. **Variation in Product Information**: Not all products have the same level of detail
2. **Mixed Content Formatting**: Some product descriptions may have HTML formatting
3. **Unknown Pagination**: Need to confirm if pagination is used on category pages
4. **Image Handling**: Multiple images may need special processing

## Recommendations for Step 2

As we move to Step 2 (URL discovery mechanism), we recommend:

1. **Start with Main Categories**: Begin by implementing selectors for the main navigation categories
2. **Build a Crawler Approach**: Create a crawler that can:
   - Extract main category URLs
   - Visit each category to extract subcategory URLs
   - Visit each subcategory to extract product URLs
   - Handle any pagination encountered

3. **Create YAML Selectors**: Develop these key YAML selectors:
   - `categories.yaml` - For main category extraction
   - `subcategories.yaml` - For subcategory extraction from categories
   - `product_urls.yaml` - For product URL extraction from subcategories
   - `pagination.yaml` - If needed for multi-page listings

4. **Test Incrementally**: Test each selector on different sections of the site before integration
5. **Document URL Patterns**: Keep detailed records of all URL patterns discovered

## Conclusion

Step 1 has provided a comprehensive understanding of the triadscientific.com website structure. The site follows consistent patterns that will allow for effective scraping through our selector-based approach. We have identified all key information to extract and are now ready to proceed with Step 2: creating the URL discovery mechanism.

All documentation created during Step 1 has been placed in the `apps/scrapers/triadscientific-yamls/` directory for reference as we proceed with implementation.

## Next Steps

1. Begin implementing the URL discovery YAML selectors
2. Test URL extraction on various sections of the site
3. Develop a strategy for handling any irregularities or exceptions discovered
4. Prepare for Step 3 (product information extractors) based on our findings
