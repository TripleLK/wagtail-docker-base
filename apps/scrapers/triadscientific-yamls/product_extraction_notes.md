# Product Information Extraction Strategy

This document outlines the approach for extracting detailed product information from individual product pages on triadscientific.com.

## Information to Extract

Based on our analysis, we'll focus on extracting the following information from product detail pages:

1. **Product Name**: The title/heading of the product page
2. **Short Description**: Brief summary when available
3. **Full Description**: Detailed product description and features
4. **Technical Specifications**: Any technical details about the product
5. **Images**: Product images URLs
6. **Category/Subcategory**: Product categorization information
7. **Models/Variants**: Details about different product models when available

## Preliminary HTML Structure Analysis

From examining the website, the following patterns have been identified:

- **Product Name**: Usually in an `<h1>` or prominent heading tag
- **Description**: Typically in paragraph tags following the product name
- **Images**: Found in `<img>` tags, often within a product gallery section
- **Technical Specifications**: Often presented in structured formats like tables or lists
- **Category Info**: Usually available in breadcrumb navigation

## Preliminary Selectors

### Product Name Selector

The product name is typically found in the main heading of the page:

```yaml
---
css_selector:
  selector: "h1"
  extract: text_selector
```

### Short Description Selector

Short descriptions are typically found near the top of the product detail:

```yaml
---
css_selector:
  selector: "div.product-summary p"
  extract: text_selector
```

### Full Description Selector

Full product descriptions are usually more detailed:

```yaml
---
css_selector:
  selector: "div.product-description"
  extract: html_selector
```

### Images Selector

Product images need to be extracted along with their URLs:

```yaml
---
css_selector:
  selector: "div.product-images img"
  multiple: true
  extract:
    src:
      attr_selector:
        attr_name: "src"
```

### Technical Specifications Selector

Specifications may be in a structured format:

```yaml
---
css_selector:
  selector: "div.specifications"
  extract:
    specs:
      for_each_selector:
        css_selector:
          selector: "tr"
          multiple: true
          extract:
            spec_name:
              css_selector:
                selector: "td:first-child"
                extract: text_selector
            spec_value:
              css_selector:
                selector: "td:last-child"
                extract: text_selector
```

## Challenges and Considerations

1. **Inconsistent Layouts**: Product pages may have varying structures based on product category
2. **Missing Information**: Not all products have complete information
3. **HTML Variations**: Need to account for different HTML structures
4. **Image Processing**: Multiple images may need proper extraction and processing

## Next Steps

1. Test preliminary selectors on various product pages
2. Refine selectors based on testing results
3. Create YAML files for each type of information
4. Develop a mapping strategy to combine all extracted information
5. Implement error handling for missing data
6. Test the complete extraction process on a sample of products
