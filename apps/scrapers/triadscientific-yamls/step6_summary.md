## Technical Implementation Details

### Parallel Processing Architecture

The parallel processing implementation uses two approaches:

1. **ThreadPoolExecutor for URL Discovery**:
   - Uses a fixed-size pool of worker threads
   - Implements futures for task tracking
   - Collects results as tasks complete
   - Provides efficient category processing

2. **Custom Threading for Data Import**:
   - Implements a producer-consumer pattern with queues
   - Creates dedicated worker threads for processing
   - Uses thread-safe data structures for results
   - Implements coordinated shutdown

### Statistics and Monitoring System

The monitoring system includes:

1. **Stats Collection**:
   - Tracks URLs discovered, processed, success/failure counts
   - Calculates derived metrics like success rate
   - Records timing information
   - Maintains error history

2. **Reporting Thread**:
   - Runs on a configurable interval
   - Uses thread-safe access to statistics
   - Formats and displays current progress
   - Calculates estimated time remaining

### Checkpoint Implementation

The checkpoint system:

1. **Saves State Information**:
   - List of processed URLs
   - Current statistics
   - Timestamp information
   - Total URLs to process

2. **Resume Process**:
   - Loads checkpoint data
   - Restores processing state
   - Skips already processed URLs
   - Continues from last point

## Testing Results

The enhanced scraper was tested with various scenarios:

1. **Parallel URL Discovery**:
   - Successfully processed multiple categories concurrently
   - Properly managed thread resources
   - Significantly reduced discovery time
   - Correctly handled rate limiting

2. **Multi-threaded Import**:
   - Successfully processed multiple URLs concurrently
   - Properly managed database transactions
   - Maintained data integrity during parallel operations
   - Correctly updated statistics

3. **Checkpoint/Resume**:
   - Successfully saved state information
   - Correctly resumed from previous point
   - Maintained statistics across restarts
   - Properly handled checkpoint file issues

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Correctly handled network failures
   - Properly managed validation errors
   - Successfully recovered from transient issues
   - Maintained detailed error logs
