# Continuation Briefing for Developer 1: SelectorConfiguration Model

## Current Status

I've implemented most of the SelectorConfiguration model requirements:

1. ✅ Created the `SelectorConfiguration` model in `apps/ai_processing/models.py`
2. ✅ Added fields for name, description, timestamps, and the JSON configuration field
3. ✅ Implemented JSON schema validation
4. ✅ Created and tested database migrations
5. ✅ Added Django admin registration in `admin.py`

## Critical Remaining Issue

The model is correctly created and registered with Django's admin, but **it is not accessible in the Wagtail admin interface**, which is what this project uses.

### Attempted Solution

I attempted to register the model with Wagtail by adding the following to `apps/ai_processing/wagtail_hooks.py`:

```python
from wagtail.contrib.modeladmin.options import (
    ModelAdmin, ModelAdminGroup, modeladmin_register
)

from .models import SelectorConfiguration, URLProcessingRequest

class SelectorConfigurationAdmin(ModelAdmin):
    """Wagtail admin interface for SelectorConfiguration model."""
    model = SelectorConfiguration
    menu_label = 'Selector Configurations'
    menu_icon = 'snippet'
    menu_order = 200
    add_to_settings_menu = False
    list_display = ('name', 'description', 'created_by', 'created_at', 'updated_at')
    list_filter = ('created_at', 'updated_at')
    search_fields = ('name', 'description')

# ... other admin classes and group registration ...
```

However, there's an issue with the `wagtail.contrib.modeladmin` import. The system cannot load this module.

## Tasks to Complete

Your immediate tasks as Developer 1:

1. **Fix the Wagtail ModelAdmin Integration**:
   - Option 1: Check if `wagtail.contrib.modeladmin` is installed - you might need to pip install a package
   - Option 2: Verify the correct import path for Wagtail's version in this project
   - Option 3: Consider registering as a Wagtail snippet instead if modeladmin isn't available

2. **Test Creating a SelectorConfiguration**:
   - Once the admin interface is working, create a test configuration
   - Verify that validation works correctly
   - Ensure all fields are saving properly

3. **Ensure UI is Intuitive**:
   - Make sure the JSON field is easy to edit in the admin
   - Consider adding help text if needed

4. **Update the Implementation Plan**:
   - Mark these tasks as complete once done

## Resources

- The model is defined in `apps/ai_processing/models.py`
- Django admin registration is in `apps/ai_processing/admin.py`
- Wagtail hooks are in `apps/ai_processing/wagtail_hooks.py`
- Example selector configuration format:
```python
[
    {
        "selector": "css_selector_string",
        "name": "Section Name",
        "note": "Optional note about this section",
        "preserve_html": True/False  # Optional, defaults to False
    },
    # More selector configurations...
]
```

After completing these tasks, you can hand off to Developer 2 who will implement the form and view updates to use this model.
