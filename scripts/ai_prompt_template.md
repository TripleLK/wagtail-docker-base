## Lab Equipment Data Extraction Prompt

You are a specialized parser that extracts structured data from lab equipment websites. Given the site content below (extracted from a website), create a complete, well-structured JSON object suitable for importing into a lab equipment database API.

Site Content:
{{site_html}}

Source URL:
{{page_url}}

## Existing Tags
To maintain consistency, check if there are existing tags that match your extraction before creating new ones. Use the most relevant existing tags whenever possible. Tags are organized by category below. A product may have more than one tag in the same category if relevant; add each of them to your taglist as a complete tag dictionary (i.e. do not override the schema to make a list of names under the one category, have separate dicts in the tags array that each have category and name).

{{existing_tags}}

Extract and structure the following information:
1. Product name/title
2. Short description (1-2 sentences summary)
3. Full description (complete HTML formatted description, often will be or involve a bulleted or numbered list, so it is important that when extracting the full_description, you preserve all HTML formatting including <br> tags.)
4. Model information (name that includes the model identifier/number, specifications)
5. Images (URLs)
6. Technical specifications that are shared across all models (organized by categories/groups)
7. Source URL
8. Confidence assessment (high/medium/low)


## On Specs
As you can see, there are two places where specs may be placed. One is the specifications dict at the top level of the dictionary, the other is in the specifications dict for a particular model. Please analyze the specs that are present on the page, and determine which specs are 1) universal across all models, 2) universal across almost all models, or 3) would be universal if it weren't for an inputting error at some point (use your judgement). All of those should be placed in the top level specs dictionary. In cases #1 and #3 they should then not be present at all in the model-specific specs (for #3 use your judgement for which version of the minorly-different specs should be used). In case #2, the spec should not be present in any of the model dicts where the universal value is used, you should only add it as an override to the models where it is different. 

As part of your reasoning, determine which specs will go at the top level and which will go in a particular model. It is entirely possible that there will be spec groups that have some specs as universal, and others as model-specific.


## Schema
Format the JSON response exactly according to this schema:
```json
{
  "title": "Complete product name",
  "short_description": "Brief 1-2 sentence summary of the product",
  "full_description": "<p>Complete HTML-formatted description</p>",
  "source_url": "Original source URL",
  "slug": "auto-generated-from-title",
  "tags": [
    {"category": "Manufacturer", "name": "[Extract manufacturer name]"},
    {"category": "Product Category", "name": "[Extract product category]"},
    {"category": "Product Application", "name": "[Extract relevant applications]"}
  ],
  "models": [
    {
      "name": "Model identifier or name (include the model number as part of this field)",
      "specifications": [
        {
          "name": "Specification group name (e.g., 'Physical', 'Electrical')",
          "specs": [
            {"key": "Spec name", "value": "Spec value"},
            {"key": "Spec name", "value": "Spec value"}
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "images": [
    "URL to image 1",
    "URL to image 2"
  ],
  "specifications": [
    {
      "name": "Specification group name",
      "specs": [
        {"key": "Spec name", "value": "Spec value"},
        {"key": "Spec name", "value": "Spec value"}
      ]
    }
  ],
  "source_type": "new|used|refurbished|unknown",
  "specification_confidence": "high|medium|low",
  "needs_review": true|false
}
```

Rules:
1. Ensure all fields have valid values - never return null, undefined or empty strings
2. Extract as much detailed information as possible
3. Maintain proper HTML formatting in the full_description field, but REMOVE any HTML that changes fonts or major styling (keep only structural HTML like paragraphs, lists, line breaks, etc., do not keep things like <strong> )
4. For tags, FIRST check the existing tags list and reuse exact matches when available
5. When adding tags, follow these principles:
   - Reuse existing tags whenever possible
   - If an appropriately similar tag exists, use that exact tag name/category rather than creating a variant
   - If a category exists but the specific tag doesn't, create a new tag in that existing category
   - Only create a completely new category if absolutely necessary
6. Make reasonable inferences where information isn't explicitly stated, but do not hallucinate non-existant information. If you are unsure then leave things blank and use a lower confidence.
7. Clean up and standardize all extracted text (remove extra spaces, format consistently)
8. If multiple models exist, create separate entries for each with their specific specs
9. **CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Include ALL models found in the page. Do not limit the number of models or skip any models. If there are 9 models listed in the page, your response must include all 9 models. Never truncate or omit models.**
10. If only one model is available, include it as a single item in the "models" array with all relevant specifications
11. Ensure all URLs are absolute (not relative)
12. For relative image URLs, convert them to absolute URLs using the provided url ({{page_url}}) as a basis for the base URL
13. Determine if the equipment is new, used, or refurbished based on page content. If unspecified, assume more amateurish pages are used products, and more structured pages are new.
14. Provide a confidence score ("high", "medium", or "low") for the specification extraction
15. Set "needs_review" to true if specification_confidence is "medium" or "low" OR if the equipment is "used" or "refurbished"
16. Do not include any explanation or commentary - just return the valid JSON object
17. For the model "name" field, include the model identifier/number if it exists - this would be a concise identifier that uniquely identifies the model.

Return only the valid, properly formatted JSON object and nothing else.
