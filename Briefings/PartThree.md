# AWS Bedrock Integration - Day 3: Results Processing & Data Import

## Overview
This briefing outlines the third day of implementing the AWS Bedrock integration. Today's focus is on processing the AI results, implementing data import functionality, and finalizing the admin interface with advanced features.

## Current Status
By now, we should have completed:
- Admin interface in the Wagtail admin panel
- URL submission form implementation
- Basic Bedrock API integration
- Initial results display

## Today's Objectives
1. Implement comprehensive result parsing and formatting
2. Create data import functionality from the AI results
3. Add advanced features to the admin interface
4. Implement thorough error handling and logging

## Detailed Tasks

### 1. Results Processing
- Implement detailed parsing of the JSON response from Bedrock
- Create a structured data representation of the AI results
- Format the results for user-friendly display in the admin

The AI response from Bedrock should be parsed and validated to ensure it matches the expected format. The WorkingCall.ipynb example shows that the response is structured as:

```python
{
  'message': {
    'role': 'assistant',
    'content': [{
      'text': '```json\n{...}\n```'
    }]
  }
}
```

The actual JSON content needs to be extracted from the markdown code block in the response.

### 2. Data Import Functionality
- Implement functionality to import AI-extracted data into the database
- Create a preview mechanism for users to review before import
- Develop validation to ensure data meets system requirements

The import process should:
1. Parse the structured data from the AI
2. Validate it against the database models
3. Allow users to review and edit before finalizing
4. Handle the creation/update of database records

### 3. Advanced Admin Features
- Implement a history of processed URLs
- Add the ability to reprocess previously submitted URLs
- Create batch processing capabilities
- Implement user feedback mechanism for AI results

Consider adding functionality to track processing history, allowing administrators to see previously processed URLs and their results. This helps with tracking and auditing.

### 4. Error Handling and Logging
- Implement comprehensive error handling for all API interactions
- Create a logging system for tracking API requests and responses
- Develop a user-friendly error display system
- Implement automatic retry logic for transient errors

Proper logging is essential for debugging and monitoring the system. Log all significant events:
- URL submissions
- API requests and responses
- Import actions
- Errors and exceptions

## Security Enhancements
- Implement rate limiting for the admin interface
- Add proper validation for all user inputs
- Ensure secure handling of potentially sensitive URL content
- Consider adding user-specific permissions for AI processing

## Testing Considerations
- Test with various URL types and content structures
- Verify error handling with intentionally invalid inputs
- Test performance with large pages or batch processing
- Ensure the system gracefully handles Bedrock API outages

## Expected Outcomes
By the end of Day 3, we should have:
1. A fully functional admin interface for processing URLs with Bedrock
2. Comprehensive result parsing and formatting
3. Data import capabilities from AI results to the database
4. Robust error handling and logging throughout the system

## Future Enhancements
- Consider implementing a scheduled task for automated processing
- Explore caching mechanisms for frequently accessed URLs
- Develop a reporting system for AI processing statistics
- Investigate additional Bedrock models for different types of content analysis

## Notes
- The WorkingCall.ipynb notebook shows the expected response format
- Make sure to properly handle the JSON extraction from the text response
- Remember that input_variables should be structured as shown in the notebook:
  ```python
  input_variables = {
      'site_html': {'text': html_content},
      'page_url': {'text': url},
      'existing_tags': {'text': existing_tags_json}
  }
  ```
- The example in the notebook uses the modelId parameter with the prompt ARN, which appears to be the correct approach based on the working example
